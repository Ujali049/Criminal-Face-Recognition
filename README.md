 I have created a Face recognition Web app using Python via Face Recognition Library and hosted the website on Anvil Server.
 
Anvil is a new way to build web apps, with nothing but Python and con connect Jupyter Notebook with the Website to run functions and models in it . 

I have provided Link to the PPT which I have created for better and clear Explanation : https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yjb5CalTRLpJxuyCz6yTUc8zS86q-OJyvKQg9mFrqlY/edit?usp=sharing
